        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>I enjoy studying science because it gives us an opportunity to learn about ourselves. Mostly, I study physics
            (quantum mechanics, astrophysics), further maths and chemistry. However, I find all areas of science
            interesting. I have 3-hour sessions with my tutor 3-4 times a week. Sometimes, I go to lectures hosted by an
            education centre where invited scientists give lectures about different areas of science. Studying science
            has enabled me to
            understand the world how it is and look at everything critically.<br><br>

        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>From my point of view, reading should be essential for everyone. A book is an inanimate teacher which can
            teach you whatever you want, just got to find the right book. Books allow us to connect with people, which
            have died, may be, hundreds of years ago and most importantly let us learn from them! Without writting and books
            there would be no written history.<br>
            I read scientific books, most of the time. However, there are some non-scientific books which I enjoy a lot
            too. Here is one of them: <br><br>
